Cell typing using IHC imaging

![Demo](https://github.com/evarol/cellTyping/blob/master/demo.png)


Step 1: Open cell_typing_one_round.m in Matlab and input .nd2 file location as "filename" variable.
Step 2: Press run and follow on screen instructions to draw ROI.
Step 3: To re-draw ROI, press run again. If you want to analyze a new image, type clear in command line before pressing run. Currently, the processed image stays in memory for quick re-analysis i.e. different layers of the hippocampus.
